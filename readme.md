# Getting Started

#### This package repo should be used as a single source of boilerplate code for any service created in the Molecule Lab when the primary Tech Stack used is NodeJS.

- First of clone the repo from Github.
- Second change the origin URL so that you don't push to the base repo
- Do the necessary changes required for the development process i.e adding any extra dependencies or modify the base route.

### Voila!!! You can start your development process now.
